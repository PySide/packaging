This README file contains instructions on how to proceed
to generate a new release using the automated scripts
(Makefile) files.

How to generate a new release:
==============================
Each component (Apiextractor, GeneratorRunner, Shiboken
and PySide) has its own Makefile. The only modifications
needed inside those files resides in the first lines:
the VERSION numbers. Updated them properly and run:

make

It might ask about release type. Go on and it will ask
for a new entry into Changelog file. Modify it where needed
and save. The new set of packages will be generated (under
the build directory) and is ready to be uploaded to the
Maemo.org build bot[1].


Not so easy:
============
Sometimes it will be needed to update manually the control
and rules files. This is needed only when you need to
set specific rules (like: conflicts with some older version).
Further information on how to modify these files is provided
by Debian packaging guide[2].


Enjoy it!
