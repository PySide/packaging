apiextractor (0.3.3-0pyside0~ppa1) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Renato Filho ]
  * Release 0.3.2.

  [ Marcelo Lira ]
  * [6d8dea5] Added methods to set and check for protected and virtual
    destructor on AbstractMetaClass objects. Also added tests for this.

  [ Hugo Lima ]
  * [c1353d4] Install FindApiExtractor.cmake in the correct directory
    when using cmake 2.8. Reviewed by Luciano Wolf
    <luciano.wolf@openbossa.org>

  [ renato araujo oliveira ]
  * [221d877] updated changelog.
  * [9e03faa] Bump version to 0.3.3

  [ Marcelo Lira ]
  * [5c8637f] Modified the AbstractMetaFunction class to have a
    separated flag to indicate that it was added by the user or not,
    instead of using the AbstractMetaFunction::UserAddedFunction enum
    value. The old way prevented the function to be an UserAddedFunction
    and a ConstructorFunction at the same time, since this information
    was stored as an enum of the AbstractMetaFunction::FunctionType
    type. A test case was also added. Reviewed by Hugo Parente

    functions are marked as CustomType isntead of TargetLangType.

  * [00a880f] Fixed support for modify args in add-function tag. Created
    tests. Reviewed by Hugo Lima <hugo.lima@openbossa.org>

  [ Marcelo Lira ]
  * [aeeb950] Adds support for module level 'add-function' tag. The
    TypeDatabase now stores global added functions as well as function
    modifications. The AbstractMetaFunction::modifications method was
    improved to check for global modifications. The test suite was
    updated with the changes.
  * [5900a05] Modified AbstractMetaFunction::hasSignatureModifications
    to check for function renaming.
  * [cb253eb] Modifications in ancestors are not returned if the current
    class reimplements the function.
  * [f2fd366] Adds normalizedSignature static method to TypeDatabase.
    All the uses of QMetaObject::normalizedSignature were replaced to
    use TypeDatabase::normalizedSignature; the former always changes the
    unsigned primitives to the shorter versions (e.g. "unsigned int"
    becomes "uint") that aren't necessarily used by the parsed library.
    The new normalizer changes back "uNUMBER" to "unsigned NUMBER" if
    the former is not present in the TypeDatabase. Reviewed by Hugo
